# IIIF

Introduction to IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework)

In this workshop, we explore the International Image Interoperability Framework (https://iiif.io/) and the work of the IIIF community to create universal standards for describing and sharing images online. With common viewing platforms, we can obtain interoperable digital image content to display, edit, annotate, and share images on the web, for example artworks, maps, and musical scores.

I led and also co-taught various workshops on IIIF, for which I wrote the handout. On 6 November 2020, I co-taught the workshop with Danielle Reay (Drew University Library) for the Rutgers Digital Humanities Initiative and Lab and the New Jersey Digital Humanities Consortium.
